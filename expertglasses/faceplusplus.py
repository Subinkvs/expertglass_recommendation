'''FacePlusPlus/Face++ Api.

In this module several necessary requests to face++ service was implemented.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please note, that to use this module it is necessary to get api-keys from:
https://www.faceplusplus.com
Otherwise functions will not work!
Examine their free api, which you can get by registrating an account on their site.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At the current state this module has already implemented:
    * Simple api request to face++ to get bounding boxes and other stuff
    for image path
    * Api request to face++ to get 1000 facial keypoints
    * Image rotation by given angle in degrees
    * Calculating measurements and statistics of face, such as angles, lengths, widths

Examples:
    To use this module, you simply import class in your python code:
        # from faceplusplus import *

    To recognize faces on image, just use the following command:
        # photo_check(base64string)

    To get 1000 facial keypoints, use the following command:
        # photo_check2(base64string)

    To rotate image by N degrees clockwise, use the following command:
        # rotate_image(image, N)

    To extract most necessary features from the image, use:
        # extract_features(imagepath)

    If image is high-resolution, you can downscale it
    to 256x256 before making a request:
        # extract_features(imagepath, resize=True)

Todo:
    * Add more functionality
